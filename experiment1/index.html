				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I made a short story generator that is funny and based on frogs</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I made a button that generates a new story. There are fixed elements of a string that make up the parts of the story/words that will always exist,
					and there are words of a string that will be filled by a word bank that I choose, which I made multiple of, for example adjectives, locations, and weather
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The process wasn't too hard, it was just making our own word banks and configuring the code to use our word banks, along with changing the fixed parts of the story. 
					It all worked out, but it was a little tricky when I tried to understand the code given to us that did the picking from the word bank; I wanted to know how it worked.
