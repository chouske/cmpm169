The first thing that inspired me to make this was that I like the look of frogs, and you can imagine one looking very funny. Secondly, I like the habitat of frogs. I like the wetlands and forests, and I also like the other animals in these areas like turtles and birds. My goals for this are to make the reader laugh, and not make a serious story. I also want the main character to feel like a friend to the reader.
