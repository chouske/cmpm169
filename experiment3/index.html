				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment a dungeon was generated and a room with various biomes around it was generated</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used a tilemap  to create tiles, and I had an array storing characters that represented each type of tile</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The process was somewhat hard. For starters, I got messed up because the tilemap is accessed using coordinates responding to x, y, but the data array is accessed using y, x.
					Understanding what drawcontext did was somewhat confusing, and getting the fog to work the way I wanted was a little difficult. Also, fixing issues with my biome generation took some time.
