				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment we have a slider that modifies the mutation on an image, the image being chosen from a drop down menu.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I drew many triangles with size and color properties of the triangles being affected by mutation. The green value is based on time so sometimes the effects on the image will start out blue but rapidly become green.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I didn't make a super fancy design but I'm satisfied and like what I made, which is supposed to simulate putting a picture into a pond full of algae. The instructions of the assignment were confusing until updated and code examples were given but after that I didn't have many issues.
