				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment 3 infinite worlds were generated, being a infinite pizza, a world in the clouds, and a never ending jungle. Tiles can be interacted with...</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Tiles were made of squares, and the world goes on forever in all directions for all 3 worlds. Changing the seed in a world can cause differences to appear</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The process wasn't too hard after looking at the way the example showed how clicks can draw something on a specific square. I was a little confused on how the has works and had problems with it but finally understood it
